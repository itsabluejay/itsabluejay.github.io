                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Most people who live in cities overlook the pigeons they pass by every day. Folks often 
                    regard these birds as pests, nuisances, dirty, and all around undesirable.
                    <br>
                    This reputation is unfair and undeserved. Modern city pigeons (aka Rock Dove) are humanities 
                    own creation- pigeons (as we know them today), would not exist without our influence. Pigeons 
                    were first domesticated at least 5000 years ago - at first as food, later to take advantage
                    of their homing ability, and eventually for show and companionship. Today, "wild" pigeons don't 
                    really exist in most of the world. The (usually) grey birds you're probably familiar with are 
                    <emphasis>feral</emphasis>. The pigeons you see everyday (if you're in a city) are descended from 
                    domestic pigeons that either escaped from captivity, or were deliberately turned loose and abandoned.

                <h2>Domestic and Fancy Breeds</h2>
                <p>
                    The most common breed of domestic pigeon is the homing pigeon (or Homer). They look a lot like the 
                    feral friends you're probably familiar with, as do many other domestic and fancy birds (They're all 
                    descended from Rock Doves, after all). You might be surprised at the amount of variety there is 
                    between domestic breeds! Over many generations, pigeon fanciers have put a lot of time and effort 
                    into selective breeding to bring out all kinds of wonderful features in these birds.

                <h2>Exceptional birds!</h2>
                <p>
                    Pigeons played an especially important military role before the invention of
                    radio and other forms of long distance communication. Their job is a dangerous one - 
                    enemy soldiers will try and shoot down birds they suspect are carrying messages.
                    <br>
                    The Dickens Medal is one of the highest military awards that can be given to an animal, and 
                    27 of them have gone to pigeons. One of these birds was named William of Orange, who belonged 
                    to the British military, and was awarded the medal for delivering a message that saved the lives 
                    of ~2000 soldiers in the Battle of Anaheim, in WW2.
